# PythonListsAndDicts

Python List and Dictionary Program



Description:
In this assignment, I use a class/dictionary Python data structure, included a list, and use a menu to guide a user to access list info. The user ultimately can view, search, or add their contact info to a list holding a temporary class/dictionary structure of contacts. Each contact has a name, phone number, email address and is referenced by the name "card" or "contact card". Code sections are labled with comments to help the reader understand my code. The user menu relies heavily on semi-accurate user input. Users can make typos and the program will try to validate on implied inference of user intended input. The program askes for decision confirmation within the flow of code and menu traversal is relativley easy to follow but is very linear. User menu options will navigate menus in a flow of decision input which allow the user to go back and forth as smoothly as possible in a linear menu paths. The user also has options depending on the input scenarios to terminate or restart the program. Due to the limited functionality of the written code program functionality has been limited to a user viewing, or searching, or adding, or can reset the contact cards and list by ending the program to allow the list to reset. Card data is reset to the original list provided in class assingment parameters.

Delivered:

Python Program Three Script: A well-documented Python script named "python_program_three.py" that contains my code for this assignment.

ReadMe must be read in order to gain admin access to the list on GitHub Classroom.

I created a demo program to show how a dictionary/class can be used to create a list and include user input.

Comments: My program is more focused on a smooth and linear user menu interface. User input and validation allows for a guided path to view,search, add, review, and terminate an augmentable temporary list of contacts. The code itself should be scalable with minimal adjustment to read and write from an existing text file/list.

Testing Results: Testing program flow and pathways resulted in all scenarios tested to be succesful with no runtime, logic, or syntax errors. All user input results in the program accepting it or requesting the user to re-enter input or return to a previous menu. The code was filtered through chatgpt which suggested to remove most of my functions for simple boolean which reduced code lines however this would have my code less readable. My functions just make it easier to know whats going on. ChatGPT did confirm my code functions as intended. It is my code and I have old code iterations to show my logical flow of adjustments I made.  

Requirements:

Created an empty list called contacts to store contact information. Each contact should be represented as a dictionary with the following keys:

'name': The name of the contact (a string).
'phone': The phone number of the contact (a string).
'email': The email address of the contact (a string).

Implemented a function called to add contacts that takes user input to add a new contact to the contacts list.

Implemented a function to view contacts that displays the list of all contacts in a user-friendly format.

Implemented a function that searches contacts that takes a name as input and searches for the contact by name. If found, display the contact's details. If not found, display a message indicating that the contact was not found.

Used formatting and string methods (e.g., format(), split(), strip(), etc.) to format and validate user input as necessary.

Additional Guidelines:

Basic: Make sure to create user-defined methods for adding, viewing, and searching for contacts.

Basic: Committed to GitHub Classroom repo whenever updated.

Advanced: Program will provide a menu with options to add a contact, view all contacts, search for a contact, and exit the program.

Advanced: Implement error handling to handle invalid user input.

Submission:

Submit your "python_program_three.py" program and update the ReadMe.md file in your GitHub Classroom remote repository by the specified deadline.
